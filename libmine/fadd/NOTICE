This directory contains Jan Daciuk's Fadd library, that was retrieved
from:

http://www.eti.pg.gda.pl/katedry/kiw/pracownicy/Jan.Daciuk/personal/fadd.html

The license for Fadd is included as License.txt in this directory.

The declaration of the 'fsa' class was moved to fadd.h, to make it
possible to use it directly, rather than through the C interface.
